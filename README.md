# Yaron Alexander Weissberg

I am a political scientist specializing in conflict and resource politics. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Konstanz.

My research focuses on the intersection of natural resources, conflict, and political stability. I investigate how natural resources influence political violence and governance, particularly in the context of decarbonization and climate change. I am also interested in the geopolitical implications of resource dependence and the stability of petrostates. My work combines spatial data analysis with causal inference techniques.

I earned my PhD in Political Science at ETH Zurich in September 2024 and was a visiting scholar at the Watson Institute at Brown University and the Political Science Department at UCLA.
